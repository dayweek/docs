## Add storage volumes

1. Click on __Servers__ > __Manage__ from the top navigation menu.

2. Select the Server on which you'd like to add an additional storage volume. 

3. Select the __Storage__ tab from the context menu.

4. Scroll down to the __New Disk__ section. Enter a name for your new storage volume, select a size, then click __Create Disk__. 

The disk will create and automatically attach itself to your server. You will need to format and mount this disk like you would a brand new physical disk.

__Note:  If your Virtual Machine does not have XenTools installed or is a Windows-based instance, your virtual machine may need to be shut down for this action to work and attach correctly.__
