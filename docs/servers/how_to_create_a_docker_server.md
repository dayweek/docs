## Create a Docker server

Now when you go to deploy a bare server, you have the option to deploy one with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) preloaded. 

Just select Ubuntu as the OS and then choose Docker in the server deployment wizard. We will automatically setup Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Docker as well as several images preloaded to help you get started. All of the included images are from the official/trusted repositories.

The images preloaded are:

* Ubuntu
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* Elasticsearch

_NOTE: You can remove any of these from your server using docker rmi repository:tag_

If you are new to Docker, we suggest running through the examples in the [Docker tutorial](https://www.docker.com/tryit/). After you have gone through the tutorials, the Docker Hub has 14,000+ images for you to use today and it just keeps growing.

Start shipping and running some docker containers!
