## Export and import Postgres data

PostgreSQL allows for users to import and export their databases, whether it’s for backup purposes or to transfer data between servers or environments.  In either case, certain formats require certain commands.  Although there are no right and wrong ways to do this, the article will focus first on the recommended way, thru Terminal, then on alternative ways. After all, we would be remiss if we did not share the other methods with you!

## Terminal
The terminal method is great for custom exporting and importing of a database. The high-level overview is the following:

1. Open up port 5432
2. Type in your Terminal commands to export or import
3. Close port 5432

Read on for more information about each.

_Note: These directions have been tested with `Postgres 9.3.x`_

#### Open port 5432

Port 5432 is the TCP port that Postgres listens in on.  By default it is closed for security.

1. Start from the Database tab (__Dashboard__ > __App__ > __Database__ tab)
2. Click on the server URL under the _Database servers_ section
3. In the new window, click on the Network tab
4. Add in ‘5432’ in both Start and End, then click Add

Keep the __Database__ tab open as the information will be needed for the export/import steps.

#### Exporting

In Terminal, type one of the following. There may be other flags you’d like to append; put those in before the > sign.  

__Uncompressed:__

    $ pg_dump -h IP_ADDRESS -p 5432 -U app -N postgis -N topology -d DATABASE_NAME > your_file_name.sql

__Compressed:__

    $ pg_dump -h IP_ADDRESS -p 5432 -U app -a -N postgis -N topology -Fc -d DATABASE_NAME > your_file_name.dump

__The variables__

These variables can be found in the __Database__ tab of your Rails app. Aren't you glad you kept this open? :)

* IP_ADDRESS = The IP address of your database server
* DATABASE_NAME = The database name of your server. This can either be your app name or db#####.

__The flags__

* -h = Host
* -p = Port
* -U = User
* -d = Database name
* -N = Exclude schema (in particular, exclude the PostGIS and topology schema if you aren’t using any of their geographic functionality)
* -Fc = Format compressed

__Optional flags__

* -a = Data only
* -c = Clean

You will then be prompted to enter the database password. This is on the __Database__ tab. Click __Show__ to view the password.

***
NOTE: If you’re exporting your database from an external hosting provider like [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export), please check their documentation.

#### Importing

Much like exporting, there’s only one step. However the command to use will depend on the type of file created during the Export process.  If using an external hosting provider’s backup file, you will most likely need to use the command for Compressed files.  The commands and flags are very similar to pg_dump with some slight nuances.

_WARNING: This will override your database! If unsure, backup your database before overriding it._

__Uncompressed:__

    $ psql -h IP_ADDRESS -p 5432 -U app -d DATABASE_NAME -f your_file_name.sql

__Compressed:__

    $ pg_restore -h IP_ADDRESS -p 5432 -U app -d DATABASE_NAME your_file_name.dump

A word on importing. Running the import command most likely will produce errors, such as “Error: role app already exists.”  This is expected behavior as the database that you’re importing into already has been created; tables, keys, and roles will already exist. However the data should transfer amicably. It is a good idea to confirm that your actual data (not tables or schema) has been transferred properly.

Yet another word on importing. If you're going from Postgres 9.2 to 9.2, you won't need the `-d DATABASE_NAME` option. 

#### Close port 5432

1. Start from the Database tab (__Dashboard__ > __App__ > __Database__ tab)
2. Click on the server URL under the _Database servers_ section
3. In the new window, click on the Network tab
4. Click Remove for port ‘5432’ and click OK to confirm.

## CLI

Database backups can be created and downloaded using our CLI. Don’t have it? Get it [now](http://www.ninefold.com/docs/getstarted/how_to_install_and_utilize_the_cli)!  The CLI method is great since you never have to leave Terminal, and you won't have top open nor close the Postgres port.

This is especially handy if you'd like to transfer your database between apps within Ninefold (e.g. transferring data from prod to staging).


#### Export (backup)

Here are the commands to create a manual backup download it to your local machine. This effectively exports your database, which is compressed via `-Fc`.

    $ ninefold signin  (Sign in with your Portal creds)
    $ ninefold db backup
    $ ninefold db download   (This will be downloaded in the current directory)

The file downloaded will be in YYYY-MM-DDTIME.tar.gz format. Open the archived file and drill down until you get to the .sql file.

#### Import

As always, we’re looking to make your life a bit easier. We now support importing in database dump files (compressed, `-Fc`).  This is especially handy if you have data-only dumps or if you're looking to move data between 2 Ninefold apps.

In the CLI, these are the commands needed to run:

    $ ninefold signin (sign in with your Ninefold Portal creds)
    $ ninefold db import FILENAME

Choose the app you want to import into and Boom! You’re good to go.

## PGAdmin

[PGAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/) is a simple and easy-to-use tool for Mac OS X users for dealing with Postgres. However, when restoring with PGAdmin, ensure that you’ve got a compressed dump file, else the restore process will not work.  You will also have to open port 5432 prior to importing the database then close it afterwards.  Directions to do that can be found above.  

1. Choose File > Add Server.
2. In the next window, fill in the information for Name (whatever you want to call it), Host, Maintenance DB, username, and Password. Click OK to continue.
3. Once the server’s been added to your list, drill down to your DATABASE_NAME.  From there, right click and choose Restore…
4. In the next window, choose the location of your dump file and choose app for Rolename. Option lists 1 and 2 have a plethora of choices to choose from. Click Restore.
5. Close port 5432 once you have completed the import process.

The messages window will display the import process. As with any import process, errors may be displayed.  It is always a good idea to review those errors and also log into the rails console via the CLI to ensure your data has been correctly transferred.
