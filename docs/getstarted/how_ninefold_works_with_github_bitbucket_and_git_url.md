## Deploy Rails from GitHub, Bitbucket or Git URL

Ninefold will pull your code in from Github.com, Bitbucket.com, or from your private Git URL. You specify the repository in Step 1 of the deploy process.

Another feature of Ninefold for Github and Bitbucket is the ability to enable _auto redeployments_.

This means that every time you push code changes to the deployment branch on  Ninefold, Ninefold will automatically redeploy your Rails app for you. Look ma, no manual redeploy! You can turn this feature on during initial deployment or toggle on/off from the __Overview__ page of your deployed app. You will need to be an admin of the repo in order to enable _auto redeployment_.

If repos + Ninefold tickles your fancy, read on.

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories and free accounts for open source projects.

If you're not familiar with GitHub, please [sign up](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) for a new account and take a look at their docs.

During your first app deployment you will be asked to enter your GitHub login credentials. This interaction happens between you and GitHub securely and will allow you to connect Ninefold to your GitHub account.

Ninefold requests read access to all of your repositories in order to populate the list of repositories from which you would like to deploy code. Admin access is needed in order to add WebHooks for auto-redeployment. If you don't have write access, then you'll need to use the Git URL option below.

With _auto redeployment_, Ninefold will trigger a Redeploy for you on every commit to the branch you've deployed against.

_Note: If you would like to limit the visibility of the account, Git URL would be your best bet._

__Special Case for Github Organizations: Github SSH Keys__

You're working on a client's app and have access to their repository. You attempt deployment through Ninefold and BAM! Something breaks. You can't deploy because Ninefold can't add an SSH key to that repo. What happened?

As a member of an organization, you may have push and pull access to a repo. However if you don't have administrative rights to it, Ninefold cannot deploy your app because Ninefold cannot add an SSH key to the repo.

A few options:

* The owner of the organization must grant you administrative rights for that particular repo. Once Ninefold adds the public SSH key to the repo, administrative rights may safely be revoked again without affecting deployment in the future. We only need to add the key once.
* Create a general account on Github for use with our portal. This will allow for instances when a person with authorization access leaves the company.
If you don't require the post-commit hooks, you can use the git URL approach and add the SSH key to your repo.

### Bitbucket

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. Bitbucket offers both paid plans for private repositories and free accounts for open source projects.

If you're not familiar with Bitbucket, please [sign up](https://bitbucket.org/) for a new account and take a look at their docs.

During your first app deployment, upon selecting Bitbucket as your code repository you will be asked to enter your Bitbucket login credentials.  This interaction happens between you and Bitbucket securely and will allow you to connect Ninefold to your Bitbucket account.

Ninefold requests read access to all of your repositories in order to populate the list of repositories from which you would like to deploy code. Admin access is needed in order to add WebHooks for auto-redeployment. If you don't have write access, then you'll need to use the Git URL option below.

With _auto redeployment_, Ninefold will trigger a Redeploy for you on every commit to the branch you've deployed against.

_Note: If you would like to limit the visibility of the account, Git URL would be your best bet._

### Git URL

If you:

* Host your repo locally
* Don't have write permissions to the Github or Bitbucket repo
* Are concerned about your Git repo's visibility
* Use a private repo hosting service like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

then the Git URL option is the one for you. Do note that the _auto redeployment_ feature mentioned in the Overview is not possible with Git URL.

You will need to generate a Git URL from your repo. The format of the Git URL will be similar to this:

	git@URL:username/gitrepo.git
* Please note that your URL must be accessible over port 80 or 443, non-standard ports are not compatible.

Simply plug the URL in Step 1 of the deploy process, and you'll be on your way to deployment bliss.
