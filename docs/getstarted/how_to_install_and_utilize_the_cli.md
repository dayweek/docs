## How to utilize the CLI

#### Why install?

The Ninefold CLI is great for managing your Rails app on Ninefold from the command line. The CLI allows you to:

* run rails console
* view and tail logs
* manage database backups
* trigger a redeployment
* run rake tasks
* much more

Plus, you can interact with our awesome mascot, Brutus, the shaved yak!

#### How to install

Open your terminal. Install this CLI with the usual gem install command to install in into your system:

    $ gem install ninefold

Remember to close and reopen your terminal after you have finished installing. You do not need to include the gem in your Gemfile but you are welcome to!

#### How to update

Ninefold regularly updates the CLI, so we encourage you update the gem prior to use:

    $ gem update ninefold

You can view your current version of the Ninefold CLI gem by typing:

    $ gem list ninefold

#### Logging

Help menu:

	$ ninefold app help logs

To view logs:
	
	$ ninefold app logs

To view a particular log (using the log title from log viewer > Sources. Note it’s  lowercase “L”). The logs in the CLI match the source name from Portal logging. 

	$ ninefold app logs -l rails
	$ ninefold app logs -l cheflog

To view a particular Host (server, e.g. from log viewer > Hosts. Note that it’s “H” not “h”):

	$ ninefold app logs -H 269e

To search logs for a specific word, e.g. ‘FATAL’:

	$ ninefold app logs -f FATAL

To search logs for a specific phrase, e.g. ‘Rendered static_pages’ (you will need quotes):

	$ ninefold app logs -f ‘Rendered static_pages’

To search logs for specific dates, e.g. from 2014/07/20 to 2014/07/25:

	$ ninefold app logs --from=’2014/07/20’ --to=’2014/07/25’

#### Tips and Tricks

If you'd like to get down to business really quickly, prepend the App_ID to the command of your choice. First, get your APP_ID:

    $ ninefold app list

Take the number associated with the app and prepend to the ninefold command like so:

    $ APP_ID=12345 ninefold command_of_choice

Don't like the animations? Pity, but we understand. To get rid of Brutus, type:

    $ ninefold command_of_choice --robot
